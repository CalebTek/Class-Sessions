List 2 differences between arraylist and linkedlist?

An arraylist is a non-generic collection of objects whose size increases dynamically
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory location.

Differences

1. Arraylist can be indexed while a linkedlist cannot be indexed instead, it uses pointers to link each element to the next one in the list.
2. Arraylist is better for random access workloads while linkedlist is better for some head-or-tail-insert heavy workloads.

List and explain 3 operations each in stack and queue

Stack

1. Push: Adds and element to the top of the stack

Queue

1. Enqueue: Adds an element to the end of the queue.
2. Dequeue: Removes and returns the element at the beginning of the queue

3. Delegate is a type that safely encapsulate a method.

1. Singlecast delegate: A delegate that points to a single method
2. Multicast delegate: A delegate that points to multiple methods.
3. Generic delegate: A delegate that can point to any method with a compatible signature.

What are anonymous methods used for in C#?

Lambda expression are anonymous methods that are can be used to create delegates or expression tree types.
Anonymous methods are used to define a method without a name. They are often used as a parameter to a method that expects a delegate.
They are helpful for writing LINQ query expressions.
