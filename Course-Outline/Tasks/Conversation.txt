Week 2 - Task 
Intro: 
This task is aimed at evaluating your understanding of data organization, structuring and access. 
Challenge 
You are required to recreate the Generic classes for: 
•	Singly Linked list 
•	Stack 
•	Queue
## Bing
To recreate the generic classes for singly linked list, stack and queue, you can declare the class as LinkedList<T>
, where T is the generic type, then modify your Add method to accept an object of type T . 
For implementing a stack using singly linked list, you can create a class Node with two fields: data and next. Then create another class Stack with one field: top. The top field is of type Node. You can then implement the push() and pop() methods .
For implementing a queue using singly linked list, you can create a class Node with two fields: data and next. Then create another class Queue with two fields: front and rear. The front and rear fields are of type Node. You can then implement the enqueue() and dequeue() methods .
I hope this helps!
## User
Can you give me an example of how to implement a stack using singly linked list?
## Bing
Sure! Here is an example of how to implement a stack using singly linked list:

[python]
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.top = None

    def push(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        new_node.next = self.top
        self.top = new_node

    def pop(self):
        if self.top is None:
            return None
        else:
            popped_node = self.top
            self.top = popped_node.next
            popped_node.next = None
            return popped_node.value

    def peek(self):
        if self.top is None:
            return None
        else:
            return self.top.value

    def is_empty(self):
        return self.top is None

    def display(self):
        current = self.top
        while current is not None:
            print(current.value)
            current = current.next
I hope this helps!

## User
What is the difference between stack and queue?
## Bing
The main difference between stack and queue is the order in which elements are added and removed. 
Stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. The operations performed on a stack are push (adds an element to the top of the stack) and pop (removes the top element from the stack).
Queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. The operations performed on a queue are enqueue (adds an element to the end of the queue) and dequeue (removes the first element from the queue).
I hope this helps!
## User

            self.head = new_node
            self.tail = new_node
        else:
            self.tail.next = new_node
            self.tail = new_node

    def dequeue(self):
        if self.head is None:
            return None
        else:
            dequeued_node = self.head
            self.head = dequeued_node.next
            dequeued_node.next = None

create the Generic classes for Stack
The Stack class should have the following methods 
•	IsEmpty() - returns true if the stack is empty and false is it isn’t

•	Push(T item) – adds an item to the top of the stack

•	Pop() – removes and returns the last item added to the stack

•	Peek() - returns the last item added to the stack

•	Size() - shows the number of items currently in the stack

The LinkedList class should have the following methods:

•	Add(T item) - adds an item to the tail of the LinkedList and returns the linked list’s size

•	Remove(T item) - removes the first occurrence of an item in the linked list, returns true if said item is found and removed or returns false otherwise

•	Check(T item) - checks for a specified item in the linked list. Returns a Boolean

## User
how is linked list, stack and queue related in C#
## Bing
A linked list is a data structure with a certain relationship between elements in memory, whereas the stack and queue are data structures with a certain interface and behavior. Stack and queue can be implemented even in arrays, so they are data structures that follow a certain rule i.e. LIFO for stack and FIFO for queue (they are not just limited to linked lists).
Stacks and queues can be implemented using linked lists. For example, to implement a stack using a linked list, we can use the head of the linked list as the top of the stack. To push an item onto the stack, we add it to the head of the linked list. To pop an item off the stack, we remove the head of the linked list. Similarly, to implement a queue using a linked list, we can use the head of the linked list as the front of the queue and the tail of the linked list as the back of the queue. To enqueue an item into the queue, we add it to the tail of the linked list. To dequeue an item from the queue, we remove it from the head of the linked list.

## User
What is a data structure?
## Bing
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. It is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. 
I hope this helps!.
## User
What are some examples of data structures?
## Bing
There are many examples of data structures. Some of the most common ones include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, and heaps. 
I hope this helps!.
## User
can you please explain the above code for implementing generic stack in C#
## Bing
Certainly! Here is an example of a generic stack implementation in C#:

[csharp]
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Stack<int> stack = new Stack<int>();
        stack.Push(1);
        stack.Push(2);
        stack.Push(3);

        while (stack.Count > 0)
        {
            int value = stack.Pop();
            Console.WriteLine(value);
        }
    }
}
In this example, we create a new Stack<int> object and push three integers onto the stack using the Push method. We then use a while loop to pop each integer off the stack and print it to the console using the Pop method.
I hope this helps!.
## User
What is a constructor?
## Bing
In object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special method that is called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's data members and prepare the object for use. The constructor has the same name as the class and does not have a return type. It can take parameters, which are used to set the initial values of the object's data members.
I hope this helps!.
